Document Flow Process

Phase 1: Document Intake (Receiving1)
External Document → Receiving1 User → System Entry
• Document Upload
• Metadata Entry (Control #, Source, Particulars)
• File Storage (Database Blob)
• Initial Processing

Key Features:
• Document upload with file validation
• Control number assignment
• Source and particulars documentation
• Automatic timestamp recording
• File preview and download capabilities

Phase 2: Document Routing and Processing
Receiving1 → Routing Decision
• Route to Receiving2 (Email/Admin Processing)
• Route to Docs (Specialized Documents)
• Route to Releasing (Outgoing Documents)
• Internal Processing

Routing Options:
1. Other Documents: Routed to Receiving2 for further processing
2. Specialized Documents: Routed to Docs role for specific handling
3. Outgoing Documents: Routed to Releasing for external dispatch

Phase 3: Secondary Processing (Receiving2)
Receiving2 Processing
• Email Document Handling
• Document Acceptance
• RTS (Return to Sender) Management
• Attachment Processing
• Final Routing

Key Features:

• RTS management system
• Attachment handling
• Document status tracking

Phase 4: Specialized Document Management (Docs)
Docs Role Processing
• GSO Documents (General Services Office)
• Travel Documents
• Application Leave Documents
• Special Permit Documents
• Folder Management System

Document Types:
1. GSO Documents: Supplier information, office details, amounts
2. Travel Documents: Traveler information, destinations, dates
3. Application Leave: Employee leave applications, types, dates
4. Special Permits: Applicant information, purposes, duration

Phase 5: Document Release (Releasing)
Releasing Process
• Outgoing Document Management
• Release Tracking
• Document Dispatch
• Release Statistics
